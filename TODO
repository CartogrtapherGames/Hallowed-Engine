Hallowed is supposed to abstract many of the system and has a philosophy : 

Avoid overly complicated system. It should feel you are cutting work not adding yourself more work. 

2. it should also be not locking you to much in one type of workflow. if you need you should be able to break of 
the normal workflow. 

TODO : maybe invest in the idea of learning Service?
